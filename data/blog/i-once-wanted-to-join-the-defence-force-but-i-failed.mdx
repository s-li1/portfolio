I think most people would be surprised to hear that I wanted to join the Australian Defence Force upon leaving high school. 

Coming from a school that focused on character development and leadership, I saw joining the military as a way to further my personal growth; a place where I could possibly build a set of values for myself, have a steady career and be a "man" ( I will come back to this later!).

In Year 11 of high school I decided to go for it. As soon as I hit 17 years old, I applied for the Australian Defence Force Academy. The academy was an opportunity to obtain a university degree, earn a salary and undertake military training- all at the same time. It seemed almost perfect to me back then.

Things were going well. Carrying onto my final year of high school, I went through interviews, check ups and was ecstatic to hear that I was invited to go to Canberra for one final assessment day. 

"This was it." I thought.

Receiving an offer to the academy would be a great moment of validation- that I had what it takes to be in the military and to be a leader.

Unfortunately I was to be disappointed that day. It was a day that has greatly changed my life and shaped who I am now. 

Starting the assessment day with full of hope and confidence, the two feelings slowly faded away. At the end of the day the results were final. I was called back into the interview room and sat down in front of the interviewers, holding my breath and clenching my fists. To this very day I still remember the words of the interviewer: 

"We will not be giving you an offer to the academy." 

Actually, maybe the words weren't that harsh. But for what was worth nearly 12 months of emotional investment and feeling like I knew what I wanted to do after high school, anything that concluded "rejection" was enough for me to feel like the whole world was falling apart.

I left the room after everything was said and done, immediately reaching out for my phone to call my Mum. I tried to stay composed but as soon as she picked up I couldn't help but cry of how heartbroken I was. 

I really felt like I was a disappointment to my parents. And I was disappointed in myself. 

I thought to myself, "You had nearly a whole year to prepare and prove to them that you were capable of being there." 

I remember feeling like I had no back up plan for what to do after high school. 

The fact that my Mum was able to pick the phone that very time was the greatest comfort to me. She quietly listened as I expressed my frustrations. There was no sign that she was upset in me. Slowly I began to realise that there was never any expectations set by my Mum nor my Dad to get into the academy- in fact, much of it was my own self pressure that my identity was in some way based on whether I was accepted.

Reflecting back, I had a lot of insecurities. I went to an all boys high school and never believed that I was the type of man that the school wanted to produce.

You see, I was the opposite of what they wanted. I was considered short, reserved and I certainly  didn't have the idealised stoic, charging-forth leader like attitude that I thought every man should have. But as I've grown older I believe that the traditional or conventional definitions of being a "man" isn't what truly makes you one. 

We often forget about qualities such as honesty, compassion, humility, responsibility and respect; these are qualities not just men should have but any person that I believe should strive for.

I wasn't happy with who I was. I wanted to be better in every way you could think of and I thought joining the military would help. And so I wonder if there are others out there that are facing or have faced the same situation that I have.

Whether it's attending a particular university, getting into a specific course or just anything, I wonder if anyone has had this feeling of being so attached to a goal that you have set for yourself that if you don't achieve it, you feel that a part of you has been crushed.

To those that have similarly faced what I did, I want to say take the time to love yourself regardless of what you have or have not accomplished. 

To those that feel they have failed in achieving something, the feelings of failure will sting at the start but they will surely go away and as the popular saying holds, "when one door closed another one opens."

I'm not going to lie that I still to this very day wonder what my life would've been like if I did get into the academy. 
Would I have been different to who am I now?  

I don't know. But maybe that's okay. 

I have grown so much more as a person than I could imagine just by failing that assessment day. Most of all, it taught me that there were many other ways to find out who I was. As I continue my current journey, I have found that my pursuit to becoming a man and a leader does not have to be bound by an academy or any career.
